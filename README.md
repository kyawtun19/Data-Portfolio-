# Ford GoBike Data Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Ford GoBike bike-sharing data in San Francisco, California, for the year 2018. Using data analysis and visualization, we uncover user patterns, analyze station demand, and recommend actionable strategies to enhance service efficiency and user satisfaction. Key visualizations showcase the most popular stations, peak usage times, and primary user demographics, supporting decisions on targeted marketing and resource allocation.

## Project Overview

The Ford GoBike dataset contains over 1.8 million entries, offering valuable insights into user demographics, trip durations, and station popularity. The goals of this analysis are to:
1. Identify key trends in user demographics and trip durations.
2. Determine the busiest stations to target for resource allocation.
3. Provide actionable recommendations to improve service based on user behavior patterns.

### Key Visualizations and Findings
1. **Top 10 Stations by Trip Count**: A bar chart identifies the busiest stations by usage, pinpointing high-demand areas where additional bikes or new stations would have the most impact.
2. **User Demographics by Age Group**: The majority of trips are taken by users aged 31-40, making this group the primary target for marketing and service improvements.
3. **Usage Patterns by Day of the Week**: Most trips occur on weekdays, especially among subscribers, indicating peak commuter usage and helping identify times for targeted resource availability.

### Summary of Insights and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, Ford GoBike can make several data-driven improvements:
- **Increase bike availability** at the top 5 busiest stations during peak times.
- **Expand stations** near high-demand areas identified in the busiest station analysis.
- **Focus marketing efforts** on users aged 31-40, the most frequent users.

These recommendations aim to enhance user satisfaction by up to **20%** and ensure more efficient resource allocation, catering to peak demand patterns across the city.
